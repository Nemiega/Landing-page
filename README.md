# Landing-page

This repository contains my submission for the Odin Project Webpage 
project. The goal of this project was to create a webpage from scratch 
using HTML and CSS, with a focus on utilizing CSS Flexbox for layout and 
positioning. The webpage is designed to be responsive and adapt seamlessly 
to different screen sizes and devices. Through the implementation of CSS 
Flexbox, I was able to create a dynamic and visually appealing layout that 
enhances user experience. Feel free to explore the code and live demo to 
see how CSS Flexbox was leveraged to create a flexible and professional 
webpage.
